                <p>
                    Last time, we defined what collaborative learning was and tried to figure out
                    what we could do within the field. By the end of our process, we ended up
                    with 3 creative objectives:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In what ways might we engage cross-disciplinary teams to efficiently 
                        catalyze groundbreaking advancements?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In what ways might we foster a transformative learning environment that
                        lets students simultaneously gain depth of their respective fields as well
                        as breadth across disciplines?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In what ways might we empower students with learning disabilities to
                        achieve two-way enrichment in their education?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Eventually, we chose to work on the last objective. Check out our process

                            We discussed common interests and analyzed various industries in an attempt to 
                            find points for improvement. Among those mentioned, there was a general 
                            inclination to revolutionize the current problems of the education system by 
                            listing off multiple prevalent issues. From there, we innovated vision 
                            statements over and over again right before converging to the particular 
                            creative objective we have now.

                            disabilities as it is a commonality that we have personally undergone. The 
                            ways in which this group will pursue such a creative objective remains to be 
                            tweaked, though it is of essence for us to keep ideating before taking any 
                            measurable and committed steps.

                            One thing is certain, however: our vocation will remain oriented towards 
                            those who experience a psychological or physical hindrance with their ability 
                            to effectively work in collaborative environments. We align ourselves with 
                            those who wish to be productive, but cannot. We understand their plight. To 
                            help them is our purpose.

                            It began as a mildly interesting topic to rant about, and slowly but
                            surely it developed into a plan to make a difference. From a topic
                            as generalized as “the learning process”, we played around with
                            various ideas and pet peeves that came from a place of pain. We love
                            learning, but there are things about it that make it difficult for
                            everyone to enjoy learning. We kept asking ourselves “why?” and “for
                            what purpose?” repeatedly until we found a creative objective that
                            everyone felt sufficiently motivated to work with. There existed some
                            iterations of the vision statement that felt impractical, so through
                            word associations we managed to scrounge up a manifestation of a goal
                            that felt crazy and open-ended yet interpretable enough to create
                            smaller SMART sub-objectives with.
